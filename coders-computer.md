# Class notes 
### A few basic terminal command prompts:

* **pwd (Print Working Directory)** the current working directory you are in
* **cd (Change Directory)** navigate through files and directories (If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory)
    * cd .. to move one directory up         
    * cd to go straight to the home folder
    * cd- to move to your previous directory
* **ls** list-used to view the contents of a directory

**I found a list of** [35 Linux Basic Commands](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands)

**Paths**
  * ( / ) Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash    
  
  * Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash
    
     * (~) This is a shortcut for your home directory
     * (.) This is a reference to your current directory
     * (..) This is a reference to the parent directory
     
**Files**

A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is
  
  * file.exe - an executable file, or program
  * file.txt - a plain text file
  * file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image
