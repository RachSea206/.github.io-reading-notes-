# Welcome to my thoughts on Growth Mindset!

Hello there! My name is **Rachael Summers** and I am super excited to be here!


## Let's talk about **The Growth Mindset**

In the words of Haffenden:
   >*“ones fundamental abilities can be developed through 
   perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset in synonymous with a love of learning.”*
   
**Growth mindset in my own words**: A growth mindset gives space when is needed or when an issue has become too complex, but still chooses to never give up. Perseverance and inspiration are key. 

Someone with a growth mindset will tackle problems until they find a solution. They will recognize when they are either avoiding challenges or losing focus during challenging obstacles at work or in life and take a step away to re-asses the issues. It’s an ego check when it comes to criticism at work or at home. I believe a growth mindset has a lot to do with doing what is right in the situation. Who does it really benefit when you fall into the ego trap of “I can’t do this, I’m not smart enough, it’s too complicated or I don’t understand this”. Growth mindset is a continued  belief that putting in the hard work and tackling challenges with continuous effort will find you the right answer.  

When I feel myself falling into the opposite mindset. 

A fixed mindset of challenge avoidance techniques (You know what I'm talking about!) I remind myself of a few things:  


* I remind myself to not fall into negative thought patterns and keep forging forward. 
* I remind myself that if I take a step back and rethink through the situation objectively I can usually come at it from a different perspective.
* I remind myself that I love learning and this is just that, a learning experience made to help me grow into a more kickass version of myself.
